            <p class="infoText">What are microgreens? You aren’t alone if you are asking that question. Microgreens are really small versions
                of plants you already know and love (well even if you don’t love some of their grown up counterparts, you
                may still love micros).
                <br>They are somewhere between a sprout and a “baby” green. Microgreens are high in nutrient density. Microgreens
                can pack a lot of flavor in a small package. They are versatile and can be added to lots of things. They
                are beautiful! They are quick and easy to grow if you want to grow your own. Microgreens are new (new enough
                that they aren’t in any local grocery stores), growing in popularity and some would call them a super food
                because they contain higher nutrient levels than their grown up counterparts. There is a lot of misinformation
                and a bit of a grey area surrounding the topic of microgreens and what to call them. I’ve seen microgreens
                also referred to as sprouts, shoots, and sprouted greens.
                <br>I’ve seen sprouts referred to as microgreens or leafy sprouts. Confusing, I know. What ever you call them,
                I want you to know the difference between microgreens and sprouts. Microgreens are not sprouts as I would
                define sprouts. Sprouts are germinated seeds, usually grown without medium, kept moist through the growing
                process. Microgreens differ from sprouts in a number of ways. Microgreens are grown in a medium (seed starting
                mix, soil, grow mat, etc). Microgreens are usually grown a little longer than sprouts. Sprouts are usually
                not grown past the cotyledon (those first leaves that appear when a seed germinates) stage. Microgreens are
                often (but not always) grown to the first set of true leaves (the next set that follows the cotyledons).
                Something grown even longer, I would call a shoot.Unlike sprouts, the seed and root of microgreens are not
                consumed. Microgreens are cut above the soil level to harvest and then washed or rinsed. Some types of microgreens
                may have a few seed hulls attached when ready to harvest. Most of these will fall off during the rinsing.
                With sprouts the entire product is kept constantly moist. With Microgreens, the seeds are kept moist until
                they germinate and then only the medium is kept moist. So now that you know what microgreens are, you can
                watch for them to pop up in restaurants and farmers markets in your area.</p>

            <h1 class="infoHeader">HOW TO HARVEST AND WASH</h1>
            <p class="infoText">If you are wondering what microgreens are you can get some general information in this post. You have your microgreens
                that you’ve either grown or perhaps purchased. I think the best way to purchase microgreens is as living
                plants. As soon as you cut or harvest the greens the clock starts ticking. Microgreens sold as living plants
                may hang out happily on a sunny window sill for an additional week or so with an occasional drink of water.
                You can also cut and use just what you need so they will always be super fresh. Honestly, I’ve read multiple
                sources on microgreens and some say they don’t need to be washed at all or just minimally if you have bottom
                watered and they are clean. I recommend washing or rinsing your greens. They really aren’t different from
                any other greens that you would buy at the grocery store and wash before consuming. Since so many things
                are prewashed now when you buy them, let’s just go through the process as a refresher. I like to take the
                greens out of the grow tray. Since they are grown in just a little bit of medium the roots and medium have
                usually formed a mat and it is easy to remove the greens, mat and all from the tray. Next take clean scissors
                and cut the greens above the soil line. The idea is to cut and not pull the greens so that the soil or medium
                stays behind. Place your greens in a colander or sieve and rinse with running water. Immerse the colander
                or sieve with the greens in another bowl filled with fresh water. Any seeds that may still be attached to
                the greens should detach and float and can be removed. Lift out the colander with the greens and rinse again.
                Let the water drain a little, then place the greens on clean kitchen towels or paper towels to dry. Once
                cut and washed, greens should be stored in the refrigerator in a loosely closed bag or loosely covered dish.</p>

            <p class="infoText">Microgreens have a higher nutrient density compared with mature greens. That’s all well and good but how do you
                get all the green goodness into your diet? Adding microgreens to your diet is about being creative and enhancing
                your favorite dishes. They can be added raw to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Salads</li>
                    <li>Soups</li>
                    <li>Sandwiches</li>
                    <li>Stir-fries</li>
                    <li>Smoothies</li>
                    <li>Wraps</li>
                    <li>Omelets</li>
                    <li>Quiche</li>
                    <li>Smoothies</li>
                </ul>
                <br>They can be juiced for green juices, or used as an edible garnish. You can use them alone as a salad or tossed
                with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Visit our recipe page for more ideas.</p>
