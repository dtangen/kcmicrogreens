                They are somewhere between a sprout and a “baby” green. Microgreens are high in nutrient density. Microgreens
                are new (new enough that they aren’t in most local grocery stores), growing in popularity and some would
                call them a super food because they contain higher nutrient levels than their grown up counterparts.</p>

                vegetable or herb. Some microgreens, like radish, cilantro and basil can have as much or more flavor as the
                mature plant. </p>

            <h1 class="infoHeader">Are they the same thing as sprouts?</h1>
            <p class="infoText">There is a lot of misinformation and a bit of a grey area surrounding the topic of microgreens and what to call
                them. I’ve seen sprouts referred to as microgreens or leafy sprouts and vice versa. Confusing, I know. Whatever
                you call them, I want you to know the difference between microgreens and sprouts. Microgreens differ from
                sprouts in a number of ways. Sprouts are germinated seeds, usually grown without medium, kept moist through
                the growing process. Microgreens are grown in a medium (seed starting mix, soil, grow mat, etc). Microgreens
                are usually grown a little longer than sprouts. Sprouts are usually harvested in 3-5 days. Microgreens are
                usually harvested in 7-14 days and grown to the cotyledon (that first tiny leaf) stage or to the first set
                of true leaves (the next set that follows the cotyledons). . With sprouts the entire product is kept constantly
                moist. With Microgreens, the seeds are kept moist until they germinate and then only the medium is kept moist.
                Unlike sprouts, the seed and root of microgreens are not consumed. Microgreens are cut above the soil level
                to harvest and then washed or rinsed. Some types of microgreens may have a few seed hulls attached Most of
                these will fall off during the rinsing. So now that you know what microgreens are, you can watch for them
                to pop up in restaurants and farmers markets in your area.
